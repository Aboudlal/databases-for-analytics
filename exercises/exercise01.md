## Question 1

**Compare and contrast the data types used for:**
- `country.Population`
- `country.LifeExpectancy`

Why were these data types selected?

### Answer
_The `country.Population` column uses the `INT` data type, while `country.LifeExpectancy` uses `DECIMAL(3,1)`._

_`INT` is used for population because it represents whole numbers, while `DECIMAL(3,1)` is used for life expectancy because it requires decimal precision. Each data type fits the kind of values stored in the column._

### Screenshot
_Show the table structure or DESCRIBE output._

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 2

**What is the data type of `country.IndepYear`?**
Why do you think this data type was selected?

### Answer
_The data type of `country.IndepYear` is `SMALLINT`._

_This data type was selected because independence years are stored as numeric year values and do not require a large range. Using `SMALLINT` is efficient and appropriate for storing year information. The column allows `NULL` values because some countries do not have an independence year._

### Screenshot

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 3

**Make a case for a different data type for `country.IndepYear`.**
Explain why your proposed data type might be better in some situations.

### Answer
_A possible alternative data type for `country.IndepYear` could be `YEAR`._

_The `YEAR` data type is designed specifically to store year values, which makes it clear that the column represents a year. In some situations, this can improve readability and make the data easier to understand when working with dates._
